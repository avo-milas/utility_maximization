<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is implemented as part of the Computer Workshop in Economics course in the "Economics and Data Analysis" program at HSE University.

The goal of any individual is to maximize utility; however, solving this problem must take into account the presence of budget constraints. This project visually illustrates how an individual will act based on the type of utility and the nature of the budget constraint.

Types of utility in the project:
- Cobb-Douglas
- Leontief

Types of budget constraints:
- Constant prices
- Fixed free quantity of goods + constant prices
- Certain quantity of discounted goods + constant prices

In each part, mathematical constrained optimization is translated into a model with parameters, where the arguments are inputted and the output consists of graphs with the consumer's problem solution.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

One part of the project requires data on purchases. It can be downloaded by [this link](http://samonenko.ru/upload/model1_data.xlsx), but it is also given inside the .ipynb
